## Milestone 1 Grading and Feedback

* Ideally, your persona page should have a picture.  Aside from that, this persona is great.  Demographic, personality, and technological information are all present and well-written.
* Your code is well-formatted and validates cleanly.  Nice work.

Overall, this is very good work.  You clearly outline a personality, and your technical work is very good.  You have a firm basis for going forward on your site, and you should be well-situated to make something clear and geared to the interest of your audience.  The submission was a little late.  You might be able to avoid the issues you had by making sure you have a working deployment and github link a bit earlier in the process.  In total, though, this is very good work.

This grades out at a Tier 3.
