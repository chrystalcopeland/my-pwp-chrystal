## Milestone 1 Grading and Feedback

* Ideally, your persona page should have a picture.  Aside from that, this persona is great.  Demographic, personality, and technological information are all present and well-written.
* Your code is well-formatted and validates cleanly.  Nice work.

Overall, this is very good work.  You clearly outline a personality, and your technical work is very good.  You have a firm basis for going forward on your site, and you should be well-situated to make something clear and geared to the interest of your audience.  The submission was a little late.  You might be able to avoid the issues you had by making sure you have a working deployment and github link a bit earlier in the process.  In total, though, this is very good work.

This grades out at a Tier 3.

## Milestone 2a Feedback

Good work here. Your content strategy is straightforward and to the point. When it comes to your wireframes, it looks like you have a good grasp on the type of design and color scheme that will be carried throughout your site. 

As a recommendation for your photos, here is an interactive gallery that provides a bit of animation and will allow for captions. http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/
Be mindful of the view on mobile. I would recommend that you stack your photos so that one and only one photo is displayed on the screen as you scroll through your site on mobile.

Additional Recommendations:

Google Fonts for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
FontAwesome is a good quality free library for including iconography.

We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no frontend-facing site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Remember use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory for now!

Edits & Suggestions:
You forgot the the DOCTYPE & HTML boilerplate code that is generally required for all files that use HTML.

Your milestone 2a passes at a Tier III
