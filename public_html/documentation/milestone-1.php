		<h2>
			Purpose
		</h2>
		<p>
			To get a client! I am so excited to put what I am learning into practice. I can't wait to use what I am learning
			to create beautiful and powerful websites for my clients.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Audience
		</h2>
		<p>
			I will be displaying this site as an example of my coding work to prospective clients and potential employers.
			My primary audience will be women owned businesses for freelance graphic design work or for a woman owned business.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Goal
		</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>My goal is to attract freelance clients.</li>
			<li>I will be able to use this site to serve as a gallery to showcase and promote my work.</li>
			<li>I also want to increase the reach of my social media presence.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Persona
		</h2>
		<p>Name: Devonna</p>
		<p>Age: 35</p>
		<p>Occupation: Self employed and her own boutique hand crafted wedding stationary shop. She has graphic design
			background and 2 employees who are graphic artists. She currently has a website in Square Space, but wants to
			create a site where clients can interactively create wedding invitations online to boost sales. She is looking for
			a freelance web designer to start, but in the long term, this person could become an employee if the website is able
			to generate revenue to sustain a full time web-developer on staff.
		</p>
		<p>Devonna and I met at a networking event for female entrepeneurs who want to support other women owned businesses.
		She specifically wants to work with a woman to create her new website, but doesn't have the money to hire a full time
		web developer for what she has in mind. </p>
		<p>
			Devonna's biggest frustration is getting clients to understand the time involved in custom stationary for weddings.
			She would like to use the website to offer both high end stationary options, but also allow some customers who want
			an affordable option to "create their own" stationary. She may even create a separate company identity for lower
			end stationary design to help boost revenue but not detract from her high end brand she has already developed.

<h2>Wellness PWP</h2>
		<h2>
			Purpose
		</h2>
		<p>
			I would like to use my pwp to develop contacts and gain clients in the health and wellness and birthing industry. I have already begun
			building websites for massage therapists and own a resource directory blog, so I would like to bridge the health and wellness
			industry to technology.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Audience
		</h2>
		<p>
			This will be a website geared toward getting web development and design clients in the health and wellness industry. It will have
			a natural soothing look and also provide statistics on how a website can help grow a client base when done well.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Goal
		</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>My goal is to attract freelance clients.</li>
			<li>I will be able to use this site to serve as a gallery to showcase and promote my work.</li>
			<li>I also want to increase the reach of my social media presence.</li>

		<h2>
			Persona
		</h2>
		<p>Name: Claire</p>
		<p>Age: 35</p>
		<p>Occupation: Yoga instructor and wellness studio owner. Wants to develop her brand and website to include alternative therapies
			such as massage and acupunture in her wellness studio.
		</p>
		<p>Claire has been DIY-ing her website for a while, but she is finding that if she can let someone else manage the website,
		she can focus on growing her business. Her wordpress website is clunky and is in need of an overhaul, and possibly some content
		revisions. She is currently working towards expanding her offerings at her wellness studio to include acupucnture and massage
		therapy. These are services she knows her clients get at other places, and wants to be able to provide these services in her
		business. </p>
		<p>
			Claire's biggest frustration is managing the online presence of her website. She loves using instagram, but wants to develop
			a better approach to her online presence- ulimately funneling her social media content to her website. She spends more time teaching classes,
			developing classes and developing talent and so her website has been suffering- her tech savvy customers are beginning
			to notice. Her class sign up process is not user friendly, and she thinks she may be missing out on some sales because
			of her confusing registration process. She is looking to streamline things, but doesn't have the time anymore to figure
			"all this website stuff out".
