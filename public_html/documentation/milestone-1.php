		<h2>
			Purpose
		</h2>
		<p>
			To get a client! I am so excited to put what I am learning into practice. I can't wait to use what I am learning
			to create beautiful and powerful websites for my clients.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Audience
		</h2>
		<p>
			I will be displaying this site as an example of my coding work to prospective clients and potential employers.
			My primary audience will be women owned businesses for freelance graphic design work or for a woman owned business.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Goal
		</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>My goal is to attract freelance clients.</li>
			<li>I will be able to use this site to serve as a gallery to showcase and promote my work.</li>
			<li>I also want to increase the reach of my social media presence.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			Persona
		</h2>
		<p>Name: Devonna</p>
		<p>Age: 35</p>
		<p>Occupation: Self employed and her own boutique hand crafted wedding stationary shop. She has graphic design
			background and 2 employees who are graphic artists. She currently has a website in Square Space, but wants to
			create a site where clients can interactively create wedding invitations online to boost sales. She is looking for
			a freelance web designer to start, but in the long term, this person could become an employee if the website is able
			to generate revenue to sustain a full time web-developer on staff.
		</p>
		<p>Devonna and I met at a networking event for female entrepeneurs who want to support other women owned businesses.
		She specifically wants to work with a woman to create her new website, but doesn't have the money to hire a full time
		web developer for what she has in mind. </p>
		<p>
			Devonna's biggest frustration is getting clients to understand the time involved in custom stationary for weddings.
			She would like to use the website to offer both high end stationary options, but also allow some customers who want
			an affordable option to "create their own" stationary. She may even create a separate company identity for lower
			end stationary design to help boost revenue but not detract from her high end brand she has already developed.
